# HTML CSS: Code Refactor 

Having been provided with existing code, for this assignment, I was tasked with refactoring the code to create a codebase that follows accessibility standards, to help optimize the site for search engines. 

When the source code is viewed, you find semantic HTML elements that follow a logical structure independent of styling and positing. All images have alt attributes and fall in sequential order. The titles are concise and descriptive.
